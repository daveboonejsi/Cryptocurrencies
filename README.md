# Cryptocurrencies

•	In this repository, unsupervised learning techniques were used to analyze data for traded cryptocurrences.. 
•	Data were first preprocessed and transformed to fit the models. Data were prepared for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means as a first step. 
•	Then the data dimensions were reduced using sklearn PCA algorithms to predict clusters in the cryptocurrency data with the K-means algorithm. 
•	Lastly, a 3D scatter plot using Plotly Express was employed to viusualize the clusters.

The jupyter notebook file is called Challenge-18-Crypto.ipynb.
